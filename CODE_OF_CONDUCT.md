# Introduction
Pyleecan project intend to create an open community of people working on electrical machines to encourage the research in this field. This community will be composed of several people with different backgrounds and perspectives. This document set a (non-exhaustive) list of rules about what is accepted in the community and what is not. This code of conduct is inspire from the [Django's one](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/).

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Pyleecan project. This includes the mailing lists, the issue tracker, the documentation and any other communication or event linked to the project. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing pyleecan@framalistes.org.

# Pyleecan code of conduct
* **Be friendly and patient**.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose**. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* There is an exception to the previous rule: Pyleecan was not created for the design, development or production of electric actuators intended to be used in military weapons or in defence applications. The Apache license enables to use the software regardless the objective, but we, as a community, **can** refuse (for instance) to answer question and request from this field.
* **Be considerate**. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Pyleecan community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Pyleecan community.
* As an application of the previous point: Pyleecan is a scientific project which aims at catalyzing applied research in electrical machines and drives.  A great diversity of modeling approaches and topologies will be progressively included, representing the diversity of electrical system applications. Therefore, **there is no such thing as “a bad model” or “a useless topology”**, there are only different approaches to simulate the same thing with different advantages and drawbacks.
* When we disagree, **try to understand why**. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Pyleecan is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Pyleecan comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
